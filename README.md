# High-School-Portal

## Project Description 
Welcome to High-School-Portal - the innovative platform for managing academic grades! Whether you're a student looking to check your latest results or a teacher eager to provide valuable feedback, we're here to make the academic experience more accessible and efficient.

### Technologies Used

In the development of High-School-Portal, we harnessed an array of technologies, each serving a vital role:

- Java with Spring Boot: This combination allowed us to expedite Java application development while enabling the creation of vital APIs and database repositories;

- JavaScript: Utilized to enhance the front-end with dynamic interactivity and creating a user-friendly interface;

- React: Renowned for its capacity to construct interactive and dynamic UI components, React served as our primary library for web application development.

- PostgreSQL: Acting as our primary database management system, PostgreSQL ensured efficient data storage and retrieval.

- Postman: Facilitated API testing and validation, ensuring the reliability and functionality of our APIs.

- Bootstrap: For creating impressive and responsive styling, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design.


  ### Challenges

  During development, we encountered a few challenges that managed to teach us important lessons, including:
  
  - Resolving Bugs in Many-to-Many Relationship: Overcame issues arising from the complex many-to-many relationship, implementing effective solutions.

  - Learning from Continuous Work: Working with minimal breaks highlighted the importance of taking pauses for enhanced productivity and well-being.
 
    ### Future Plans

- Enhancing UI: Striving to further improve the user interface for a more intuitive and visually appealing experience.

- Implementing Action Alerts: Intending to add alert notifications to provide immediate feedback on user actions, indicating whether the action was successful or not.
